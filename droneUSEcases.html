           <b>DRONE USE CASES</b>

  <h1 style="text-align:left;">

    Use case 1: Be able to land on any flat serface
  </h1>

  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000">
  Not every drone is desgined with the intent of landing on any flat serface some don`t even land at all. Unlike those drones which require someone to catch them or grab them out of the air I would beable to land my drone anywhere I desire. This function could also come in handy if I run into any issues mid flight and need to put the drone down early.

  <h2 style="text-align:left;">

    Use case 2: In-Flight-Adjustment
  </h2>
 
  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000"> 
I would like my drone to be able to adjust itself during flight in case of unexpected wind. This will help the drone in mainy ways but it will primarly keep the drone balanced during flight and prevent it from being flipped over. This will also help if the drone is ever carring any additional weight that could be adding extra tension in a piticular direction.

       Use case 1: Using a camera to see
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000">
A camera attached to a drone can act like an extra pair of eyes and even give you the view of a bird. This ability is very common on modern drones and helps you get a better and up close view of what is around the drone. You could also use this camera for many kinds of potography, find somthing that has been lost, take videos or even more illegal acts.

    <h3 style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="6" color="#000000">
       Use case 1: Light Up With RGB
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left;">
	<font face="seirf" size="5" color="#000000">
Adding a set of led lights or RGBs to the bottom of the drone will be very helpful in many ways. You will be able to see it easier from the ground on days with poor visibility. Also I personally would program it to change to a certain color after the battery life gets to a certain point to remind me that I need to bring the drone back to the ground.
